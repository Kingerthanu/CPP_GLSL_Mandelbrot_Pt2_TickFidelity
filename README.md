# CPP_GLSL_Mandelbrot_Pt2_TickFidelity
C++ OpenGL GLSL Program Which Uses the Mandelbrot Model With A Tick Uniform To Increase Fidelity With Runtime Does Some Trippy Stuff. I also 
changed some constant variables to help with the pulsing push-through of colors. This one is a little flashy so please
be mindful of the eye strain this can and probably will give. _tickTimer controls our zoom and rate of change, while _tick does
fidelity. 
This program helped educate me on uniforms and GLSL optimizations. It also informed me on nuances with sin to give nuanced color patterns
as well as helped me find good usages for things like triangle_fan.
